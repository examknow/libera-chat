<!-- DIAGNOSTIC

Please check on https://status.matrix.org that we are not already aware of the problem.

If you are a Matrix user and are running your own homeserver (your Matrix ID doesn't end with `:matrix.org`), please do a federation check at https://federationtester.matrix.org/ for your homeserver
